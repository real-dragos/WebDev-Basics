# WebDev-Beginner

This is a Repository where I store simple examples and snippets of code that I write while learning new (and old) things related to web development.

It is called WebDev-Beginner because it refers to basic topics of web development such as: new CSS properties, simple widgets, reminders of old ways of implementing things, HTML5 elements and so on.
